BVH_ray_tracing
===============

High Performance Ray Tracing

• Implement a real-time ray tracer to handle deformable objects using parallel techniques.

• Study on the data structure and implement a good ray tracing engine which is suitable for deformable scenes using parallel methods.

• Paralell the process of both building BVH and ray tracing in BVH.

• With 32 cores, we have a speed-up up to 4.9 in builing a BVH.

• Have a speed-up up to 3.6 in ray tracing using 4 thread to 1 thread.
